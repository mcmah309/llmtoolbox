If all the functions in a tool return concrete types then Tools `E` type is `Infallible`.
If all of the tools return have the same return type `T` or `Result<T,_>`, then `O` is that type.
Otherwise, `O` is `Box<dyn Any>` and `E` is `Box<dyn Error`.

Make sure `Tool` is implemented for `Box<dyn Any>` and `Box<dyn Error` and an more explicit ones
if the above holds.
